### What I learned

This is the first time experimenting with Gatsby. The development experience was great.

One thing that was a painfull experience, was NPM. I experienced a couple of peer depency errors. After a while, I experienced dependancy problems. I think this may because I used a [Gatsby starter project](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) which initially came with Gatsby^2. This experience taught me the basic of dev dependancy & how different modules dependend are compatible with different versions of other modules.

### Continued development

In this project, I was really hoping to experiece the Gatsby's GraphQL layer & how Gatsby optimizes iumages. Unfortunately this project only had an svg logo. I saw no purposes of trying to optimize the svg image, so I just put in the static directory.

Another point of interest for me is the use of [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-filesystem).
